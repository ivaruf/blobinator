Analysis:The provided changes focus on excluding the shield power-up from the decay system. This involves modifying the `updatePowerUpDecay` function to iterate only over 'rapid', 'spray', 'bullet', 'speed', and 'multi' power-up types, effectively making the shield power-up permanent. Additionally, I will address the bug in firepower and the location of shield indicator and shield decay.
